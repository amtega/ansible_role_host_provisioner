# GENERAL SETTINGS
# ==============================================================================

# Provisioning stage that the role is managing. Each stage must be run against
# an specific host type and in the specific order that is detailed below:
#
# Host connected to backends:
#
#   - cleanup_stalled: cleanup all hosts considered stalled.
#   - provisione: create the necessary hosts items in the backend (e.g. a
#     virtual machine)
#
# Host running dhcp:
#
#   - setup_dhcp: creates the necessary dhcp entries for the hosts to
#     provisione
#
# Host running cobbler:
#
#   - setup_cobbler: creates the necessary cobbler entries for the hosts to
#     provisione
#
# Host connected to backends:
#
#   - install: launch install of the hosts to provisione
#
# Host running dhcp:
#
#   - inventory: setups entries in the ansible in-memory inventory for the
#     hosts to provisiones
#
# Host connected to backends:
#
#   - wait: wait for new provisioned hosts to be installed
#
# Provisioned hosts (group defined in the variable `host_provisioner_group`):
#
#   - configure: run mandatory roles on the new provisioned hosts
#
# Host connected to backends:
#
#   - finalize: finalize provisioning of the new hosts (e.g. setup final
#     network devices)
#
# Host running dhcp:
#
#   - cleanup_dhcp: cleanup dhcp entries used to provisione hosts
#
# Host running cobbler:
#
#   - cleanup_cobbler: cleanup cobbler entries used to provisione hosts
